                    <h3>CSS Transitions, Animations and Others</h3>
                    <p>When your screen is at least 800px wide, you should be able to see the transitions. This happens when you a) hover over the section or b) focus onto the section.</p>
                    <p>For the keyframe animation, I opted to have the h1 in the header slowly grow. My reasoning behind that was to simulate a similar situation a plant would be in. It takes 30 seconds to grow and may not be initially noticable.</p>
                    <p>As for the flexbox/grid, I used both of them but didn't go into great detail like we did in the assignments. Flex/grid usage was for formatting</p>

                    <h3>PHP/Database</h3>
                    <p>For my PHP/database part, I created a comment-like form similiar to what you would find in assignment 7. Here, users would ask questions or provide advice based on a certain topic. There is both HTML and PHP form validation that tells you what you can and cannot type. In addition, PHP error messages are written but the HTML validation overrides it so you can't see it. I used a preg_match format for the name validation on the PHP side.</p>
