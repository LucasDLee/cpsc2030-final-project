                <h2>What is Gardening?</h2>
                <p>Gardening is the practice of growing and cultivating plants as part of horticulture. In gardens, ornamental plants are often grown for their flowers, foliage, or overall appearance; useful plants, such as root vegetables, leaf vegetables, fruits, and herbs, are grown for consumption, for use as dyes, or for medicinal or cosmetic use.</p>
                <p>Gardening ranges in scale from fruit orchards, to long boulevard plantings with one or more different types of shrubs, trees, and herbaceous plants, to residential back gardens including lawns and foundation plantings, and to container gardens grown inside or outside. Gardening may be very specialized, with only one type of plant grown, or involve a variety of plants in mixed plantings. It involves an active participation in the growing of plants, and tends to be labor-intensive, which differentiates it from farming or forestry.</p>

                <h2>Tools</h2>
                <p>To tend a garden you need tools, and a fairly small selection will cover most routine tasks. Tools are versatile and can be used for more than one purpose, and you can build a more comprehensive kit over time.</p>

                    <h3>Spades and Forks</h3>
                    <p>These tools cultivate the soil and come in various sizes. Choose one with a long enough handle to suit your height and light enough to manipulate easily.</p>

                    <h3>Gloves</h3>
                    <p>While gardening can be a wonderful hobby, it can quickly turn into a thorny and splintery hassle without the right pair of gloves.</p>

                    <p>When traversing your garden, having a watering can around is handy to water your plants when a hose isn&apos;t around.</p>

                    <h3>Pruning Tools</h3>
                    <p>Hand pruners, also called secateurs, help reign in plants that are getting out of control and taking over. Anvil-style pruners cut with a sharp blade meeting a flat surface, similar to a knife on a board. Bypass pruners cut with a sharp blade passing by a sharp-edged flat surface, more like scissors.</p>

                    <h3>Loppers</h3>
                    <p>Another cutting tool, loppers are basically long-handled pruners used to trim hard to reach areas and cut thicker branches. The long handles provide the leverage it takes to cut through branches up to an inch or more in diameter. There are anvil and bypass types, just like pruners. Handles generally range from 16 to 36 inches.</p>

                <article>
                    <h3>Spring and early summer &dash; getting started with planting</h3>
                    <p>Once your plot is prepared, mark out the beds or rows you plan to use, and start planting whatever crop(s) are appropriate to the season, following recommendations for spacing, fertilizer, etc. given in the quick reference guide to vegetable planting.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Summer and early fall &dash; planting and harvest</h3>
                    <p>As you move through the summer and early fall, some plants will reach maturity and youâ€™ll want to take them out, potentially replacing them with other crops (see garden plans for suggestions on how to plan out these successive plantings).</p>
                    <p>Other plants (long&dash;season crops like parsnips or winter squash) will just stay in place, growing all season long.</p>
                    <p>Weeding is CRITICAL. You can do a little weeding each day, or you can weed thoroughly once a week, but if you wait more than a week to weed, you&apos;re asking for trouble.</p>

                    <h3>Fall &dash; preparing for frost and dealing with it when it comes</h3>
                    <p>Be careful as it gets colder. When there is about to be a frost, there are a number of things you may wish to do in your garden before the frost, including harvesting all remaining tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and cucumbers, and potentially covering some of your greens or other vegetables with floating row cover to keep them warm.</p>
                    <p>Besides protecting what you already have in the ground, you might want to consider the use of floating row cover or some other season extension technique like a cold frame to start a late crop of greens (especially spinach). With a cold frame, you can plant spinach in September and harvest it in October, November, or even early December.</p>

                    <h3>Late fall &dash; preparing the garden for winter</h3>
                    <p>In late October and early November, the weather becomes consistently cold providing an ample environment to put in some work. Putting away hoses, sprinklers, and other tools should take relatively little time. Hoses and sprinklers always have some water in them, and when it freezes and expands, it can damage these tools. For this reason, hoses and sprinklers should ideally go in a place where they will not freeze. If this is not possible, put them in any sheltered place.</p>
                    <p>Dry off any floating row covers you may have used, fold them up, and put them away in a sheltered place. Gather up any wooden stakes and other wooden structures you have built and stack them under shelter to reduce rotting. Tomato cages and metal stakes should be pulled out of the soil but left outside &dash; the exposure to the elements will help kill any disease&dash;causing organisms that may be on them.</p>

                    <h3>Winter and early spring &dash; resting and planning</h3>
                    <p>When you&apos;ve done however much (or little) work you want to do to prepare your garden for winter, there&apos;s not much to do until January or February, which is when many gardeners start to think about what they want to grow and begin ordering seeds.</p>
